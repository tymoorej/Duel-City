Section: EA1

Accessories:

2 Arduino Mega Boards (AMG)
USB cables
Wires
LCD Monitors
Joysticks


Wiring:

LCD monitor on both Arduinos 
LCD monitor is attached from E10 to E19
E10 <--> GND
E11 <--> +5V
E12 <--> port 8
E13 <--> port 7
E14 <--> port 5
E15 <--> port 6
E16 <--> port 51
E17 <--> port 52
E18 <--> port 50
E19 <--> +5V


Joystick on both Arduinos:
Joystick is attached from F57 to F61
F57 <--> GND
F58 <--> port 9
F59 <--> port A1
F60 <--> port A0
F61 <--> +5V


On one Arduino:
Pin 13 <--> +5V (through a resistor)

On the other:
Pin 13 <--> Ground.


Between the two Arduinos:
GND <--> GND 
TR3 <--> RX3
RX3 <--> TR3

To run the code:
Change the directory of your computer into the file Duel_city and then
type the keyword: "make" into the command line to compile the code and
then type the keywords: "make upload" into the command line to send the
code to the Arduino to run. Do this on both computers with one Arduino 
plugged into each one.

While running our code:
The user can move the joystick up and down on the selection menu. To 
select an option you have to press down on the joystick. The code will
continue to run into one of the characters is killed by the other.

Assumptions made:
That the user will select an option each time that the selection menu pops up.

Helpful Information:
In order to make the main file Duel_city less crowded, we added more files
these include: globals.h which includes all our global variables, attacking.h
and .cpp which declares and defines all functions involving attacking and the
battle, lcd.h and .cpp which declares and defines all functions involving 
printing and drawing to the LCD screen, and handshake.h and .cpp  which declares
and defines all functions involving the communication between the two Arduinos. 
For further information on each file please refer to the comments at the top of
each file and before each function.
